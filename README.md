Tweetit
--------
Tweetit is a pretty simple java based command-line bulk tweeter application capable of automatically tweeting, retweeting and cloning existing tweets from twitter stream. Tweetit was primarily created for the ones who work for twitter campaigns fighting for a good cause. This application can be further extended to schedule tweets using readily available scheduler tools that come pre-installed with any operating system. This application may also be useful for product marketing and sales announcements using a trending hashtag to get maximum reach.
